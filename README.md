# best-arm-identification

We rewrite the Julia code of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) by using Python language.  
The code of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) can be downloaded from
https://github.com/jsfunc/best-arm-identification.

## How to proceed ?

### mainBAI.py is the code for track-and-stop algorithm of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016).
main_contextualBAI.py the code for our proposed contextual track-and-stop algorithm.

### Choose the parameters of your bandit problem in mainBAI.py main_contextualBAI.py and before running these files. 
The code is mainly written for a bandit model with two contexts. You can rewrite the code for the case with more context easily.
#### zeta: probability of context.
ex. np.array([[0.5, 0.5]]).T
#### mu: marginalized mean rewards
ex. mu = np.array([[0.5, 0.45, 0.43, 0.4]]).T
#### mu_temp: conditional mean rewards
mu_temp = np.array([[0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1]]).T  
The counter part is computed from zeta and mu.
#### delta: confidence.  
ex. delta = 0.1
#### num_similator: number of simulations.
ex. num_simulator = 20

# Configuration information

Experiments were run with the following python and scipy version: 

python: 3.7.5
scipy: 1.4.1
